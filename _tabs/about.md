# About Me

Hello! I'm a student with a deep curiosity for **Computer Science** and **Linguistics**. I delve into **software development** and **computational linguistics**, combining engineering with technology and language.



I use **[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)** as my primary OS for its flexibility and efficiency. It allows me to tailor my development environment precisely to my needs. I frequently work with **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [C++](https://cplusplus.com/), and [Bash scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))**, utilizing them for automation, AI development, and computational simulations. I also explore **[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)** and **[natural language processing(NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)**, combining them with my passion for linguistics.

This blog serves as a space to document my progress, share insights, and showcase projects related to my interests. If you have similar interests, let's connect!
